# IMAGE COMPRESSION WITH K-MEANS ALGORITHM (FROM SCRATCH)

# Descriptions
Image compression refers to the process of reducing the file size of an image without significantly compromising its visual quality. It is a technique used to store, transmit, or display images more efficiently, saving storage space and reducing transmission bandwidth requirements.  

In this project, I've applied machine learning algorithm K-means into image compression. My idea is labeling pixels which are near together by one color with K-means. Moreover, I haven't use any machine learning libraries but implemented K-means algorithm from scratch, which is a good way for learning how K-mean work.
